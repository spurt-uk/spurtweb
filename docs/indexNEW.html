               <br><b><font face="Arial" size="4"> Many medicines are supplied in blister 
        packs formed of aluminium welded to plastic. Each pill is protected in 
        its individual compartment. When the pills have been used, the container 
        is then discarded. But it cannot be put in kerbside recycling bins because 
        it is very difficult and thus expensive to recycle and the blister packs 
        end up in landfill. <br>
        <br>
        Two UK companies specialise in recycling blisterpacks--the aluminium into 
        ingot, and the plastic into plastic building board or similar. But the 
        value of the product is not nearly enough to pay for the cost of recycling. 
        The company we work with sends us a cardboard box as a flat pack; we then 
        fill it with blister packs and they send a courier to collect it. For 
        this service, we pay them £108 per box. There are some generous businesses 
        which are prepared to pay for these boxes and to allow blister packs to 
        be deposited in them and buy another box when the first one gets full. 
        But this approach is very patchy, and many communities do not have access 
        to such a service.<br>
        <br>
        Our approach is to find people who are prepared to donate towards a starter 
        box to any new community which wants to be affiliated with us. The donated 
        box is sent to the new group. They announce to their community that the 
        box will be available for depositing blister backs for one morning every 
        two months or so, and that they will be asked to contribute £1 for every 
        50 blister packs to replace this box when it is full. The box may take 
        two or three months to fill but by then there will be enough contributed 
        money to buy another box. <br>
        <br>
        The details of how the aluminium and plastic in blister pack are separated 
        is explained <a href="article.html">here </a>for those interested <br>
        <br>
        We believe that this approach can enable communities, large and small, 
        to significantly reduce the number of blister
		 packs going to landfill. <br><hr>
