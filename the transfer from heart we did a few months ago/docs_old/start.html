    <td> <font face="Arial" size="6">How to start a new SPuRT group</font><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
      <br>
      <font size="5">You need 5 things to get started:</font></font> 
     <font face="Arial" size="4"><font size="5"><br>
      (1) Funding of £108 for the first box (but we can help with this)<br>
        (2) 2,3, or 4 people prepared to devote a whole mornig every two months<br>
        (3) If possible, one person to do additional marketing<br>
        (4) a minimal amout of equipment<br>
        (5) space to store a box, if partially filled, till the next event</font></font><p></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="5">Here are the requirements in 
        more detail:<br>
        <br>
        (1) The first box needs to be ordered from collections@myrefactory.com. 
        It costs &pound;108*. We have some matching funding available, so you 
        may only need to raise &pound;54 from generous people locally.. <font size="3">(The 
        ordering link is: https://shop.myrefactory.com/product/medicinal-packaging-blister-pack-recycling-box)</font><br>
        <br>
        (2) You may have friends who might like to get involved, or perhaps a 
        local group like the WI would be a suitable place to ask around. The initial 
        groups in Wiltshire resulted from posts on Nextdoor asking &quot;Does 
        anyone know where we can get blister packs recycled?&quot;</font><br>
        <font face="Arial" size="3">You can emphasisie that this is a social group, 
        so it is a ice thing to take part in, and it is a good way to get to know 
        more peoplein your community.<br>
        You can also empahasise that the time commitment is simply the three or 
        four hours every two months, so it is not that much<br>
        </font> <br>
        <font face="Arial" size="5">(3) The initiial events were announced on 
        the Nextdoor website, supplemented by a few notices on local notice boards. 
        This got very good results. It would be desirable to do posts on Facebook 
        and other social media, and in small localities, to use notices in church 
        porches or village notice boards. You could also consider doing leaflet 
        drops. The big advantage of Nextdoor is that it was very ecoomical on 
        time, which in the intial phase was a scarce resource.<br>
        </font> <br>
        <font face="Arial" size="5">(4) You need somewhere to sit since you are 
        there for some time, and also a small table. Salisbury Market lace worked 
        well because the local cafe were happy for us to use one of their tables. 
        We had five small counting trays, so that we could count out eveery 25blister 
        packs, and when we had 4 lots of 25, we put them into a large red box. 
        You don't have to count them - you can do it by weight (25 packs weigh 
        just under 100 grams), or you can just estimate it visually. <b>The essential 
        is get enugh in donations to pay for the next box</b><br>
        Youneed a container for the contributions yu collect - we used an old 
        coffee jar with a slot in the lid, produced by drilling a cole and tehn 
        cutting the slot with a stanley knife</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="5">(5)The box may not be completely 
        full on the first occasion, so you may have to store it half-full till 
        next time. The box measures 27 x 27 x 90 cm, so you probably don't wwant 
        it in your hall for 2 months!y</font><br>
		You will also need a container for the money yu collect - we found an empty coffee jar worked 
		quite well, and we had drilled a hole and then cut a slot with a stanley knife to allow 
		enough space for tinwo-pound coins
      <p><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
        The model we have developed is designed to be sustainable in the long 
        term with minimal time involvement and minimal administration, in short 
        a true citizens self-help group </font> <img src="pix/	_JLB1291_blisterpack.jpg" width=700>
